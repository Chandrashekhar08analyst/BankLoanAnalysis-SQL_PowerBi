# 🏦 Bank Loan Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project analyzes bank loan data using **SQL (PostgreSQL)** for data processing and **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards. It focuses on understanding loan performance, customer profiles, and repayment trends.

## 💻 Technologies
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: Querying and analyzing data.
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation for data visualization.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **SQL Analysis**:
   - Key queries: Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.
   - Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) calculations for time-based metrics.

2. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - **Dashboard 1: Summary**: Key metrics like loan applications, funded amounts, and good/bad loan segmentation.
   - **Dashboard 2: Overview**: Visualizations including line charts for trends, filled maps for regional analysis, and bar charts for loan purposes.
   - **Dashboard 3: Details**: A comprehensive grid view of all loan metrics.

## 🔥 Key Insights
1. **Good Loans**: 86.2% of total loans; **Bad Loans**: 13.8%.
2. **Loan Term Analysis**: 36-month loans funded $273M, 60-month loans funded $162.7M.
3. **Employment Length**: Borrowers with over 10 years of employment provide more repayments.
4. **Profitable Loan Purposes**: Debt Consolidation ($253.8M received) and Credit Cards ($65.21M received).

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Target Long-Term Employees**: Lower risk, higher repayment.
2. **Focus on Debt Consolidation and Credit Cards**: Most profitable loan purposes.
3. **Improve Risk Assessment**: Reduce bad loans through better profiling.
